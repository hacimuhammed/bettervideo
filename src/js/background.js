/* background.js
 *
 * This file has an example of how to make variables accessible to other scripts of the extension.
 *
 * It also shows how to handle short lived messages from other scripts, in this case, from in-content.js
 *
 * Note that not all extensions need of a background.js file, but extensions that need to persist data after a popup has closed may need of it.
